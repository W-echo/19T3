# COMP9021 19T3 - Rachid Hamadi
# Quiz 7 *** Due Thursday Week 9
#
# Randomly generates a grid of 0s and 1s and determines
# the maximum number of "spikes" in a shape.
# A shape is made up of 1s connected horizontally or vertically (it can contain holes).
# A "spike" in a shape is a 1 that is part of this shape and "sticks out"
# (has exactly one neighbour in the shape).

# Returns the number of shapes we have discovered and "coloured".
# We "colour" the first shape we find by replacing all the 1s
# that make it with 2. We "colour" the second shape we find by
# replacing all the 1s that make it with 3.
